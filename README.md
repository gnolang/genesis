# Gno.land Genesis

## Introduction

We are building a DAO for Gno.land, focusing on contributions over financial
stakes. Our goal is to create a new community and ecosystem driven by
contributors. This involves redefining what constitutes a contribution and
ensuring we have a minimal constitution while allowing for extra suggestions
that are not rules but good practices.

## Vision and Missions

- **Goal of the DAO**: To create a decentralized, community-driven ecosystem
  that values contributions over financial stakes.
- **Why Gno.land DAO Matters**: It fosters innovation, collaboration, and
  inclusivity.
- **Specifics of this DAO**: Focus on proof of contributions rather than proof
  of stake.
- **Future Plan**: Develop a robust ecosystem of DAOs that govern various
  aspects of Gno.land.
- **Launch Timeline**: To be determined.
- To allow permissionless, scalable quality contributions.
- **TODO**: Explain this specific case.

## The Plan

The framework of Gno.land DAO consists of essential subDAOs that enable the
expansion of the DAO into additional subDAOs before and after the launch.

### Essential Components of Gno.land DAO

Here are the significant DAOs that will govern the Gno.land DAO:

- **GovDAO**: The governance entity. Responsible for governing the chain, and
  the top-level treasury. Real world equivalent: board.
- **WorxDAO**: The operational entity consisting of managing day-to-day tasks,
  ease the contributions and measure performance. Real-world equivalent: Human
  resources, management..
- **Evaluation DAO**: The engineering entity composed of experts, responsible of
  reviewing the quality of code-based contributions. Real-world equivalent: QA.

### Collections of Gno.land DAO

- **Growth DAO**: Invests wisely in our treasury with growth strategies.
- **Operational DAOs**:
  - **Support DAO**: Allows scalable and distributed support.
  - **Marketing DAO**: Facilitates creative ways to connect and expand with the
    community.
- **Engineering DAOs**: Speeds up development by having clear ownership of small
  libraries.

## Building the DAOs Structure

- **Sub DAO Formation**: How to create new DAOs?
- **DAOs Collaborations**: How are the DAOs collaborating? How to provide/use
  services across the multichain of DAOs.
- **DAO Recommendation**: How to suggest new DAOs.
- **Encouraging Competition**: How we encourage competition and allow easy
  proposals for extensions.

## Governance

- **Power Distribution**: How power is distributed within the DAO.
- **DAO Membership Management**: Scaling and managing membership.
- **Owning the Chain**: Empowering the ecosystem (like being the ICS provider,
  but not only for consensus).
- **Independence & Collaboration**: Gno.land DAO should remain autonomous. Adopt
  a **Declaration of Independence** and **Constitution** with cryptographic
  signatures.

## Funding of the Development of the Sub-DAOs

- **Funding Mechanisms**: How are the sub DAOs funded?
- **Budget Setting**: How can the DAO set budgets for its objectives?
- **Decision Making**: Who decides on the budget?
- **Payment**: How is the DAO paid?
- **Treasury Management**: Managing the DAO's treasury.
- **Proof of Contribution (PoC)**: Allows making the whole ecosystem safer
  against cartels and problems with money in general.
- **Disclaimer**: Gno.land DAO wonâ€™t depend on PoC, but PoC depends on Gno.land DAO.

## Constitution

- **Fundamental Principles**: Shared across all the DAOs.
- **Sovereignty**: The sovereignty of the DAO.
- **Rights and Liberties**: Rights and liberties of the DAO.

## Language and Technical Specifications

- **Go Base/Gno Base**: The technical foundation.
- **Gno.land Blockchain**: Links and details.
- **Upgradability and Future Proofness**: Ensuring the DAO is future-proof.
- **IBCx**: Inter-Blockchain Communication extensions.

## Security

- **Ensuring Security**: How we ensure the security of the DAO.
- **Reporting**: How/who reports on the security of the DAO.
- **Audits**: Conducting audits.
- **ICSx**: Inter-Chain Security extensions.

## How to Contribute?

- **Community Contribution**: How can the community contribute?
- **Getting Involved**: How to get involved.

## TODO

- [ ] Draft the Constitution
- [ ] Define what constitutes a contribution
- [ ] Establish governance structure
- [ ] Outline roles and responsibilities
- [ ] Develop voting mechanisms
- [ ] Create dispute resolution processes
- [ ] Document good practices
- [ ] Gather community feedback and iterate
- [ ] XXX
